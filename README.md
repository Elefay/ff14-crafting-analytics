# FF14 Crafting Analytics

This program analyzes Final Fantasy XIV crafting recipes and their marketability based on information from XIVAPI and Universalis. It supports all crafting professions and all servers in the Aether data center. It gives values for the past 7 days and the past 30 days and treats normal- and high-quality products separately. For each recipe, it lists the average profit as a value and a percentage (assuming a 5% tax on buyers and sellers), compares the quantity sold at or above the average price to the total quantity sold, and lists the average profit per day based on the total number of sales. Clicking a row displays a list of ingredients and their average prices, and clicking a cell with a â‡³ symbol sorts the table by that column. Recipes can be selected, which generates a summary and an exportable shopping list. API responses are cached with IndexedDB, outliers are identified by median absolute deviation, and view logic is handled with a simple, React-inspired pattern and the native DOM API. It runs locally and on [GitHub Pages](https://elefay.github.io/ff14-crafting-analytics/).
